I am Yuhui Zhu, a Ph.D. candidate in the National PhD Program in Cybersecurity at the Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies and the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca.

Since February 2023, I have been a PhD researcher at the [ReTiS Laboratory](https://retis.santannapisa.it/) under the supervision of [Prof. Alessandro Biondi](http://retis.sssup.it/~a.biondi/). I earned my Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Jinan, China, in June 2022, where I was supervised by [Prof. Zhenxiang Chen](http://loci.ujn.edu.cn/).

From February to August 2025, I was a visiting researcher with the [VUSec group](https://www.vusec.net/) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, where I collaborated with [Prof. Cristiano Giuffrida](https://www.vusec.net/people/cristiano-giuffrida/).

See more about me on [misc page](/misc/).

## research

My research focuses on the security of computer systems and broader cybersecurity engineering topics, including microarchitectures, embedded systems, operating systems, and foundational software. In particular, I work on:

- Developing advanced techniques and theories to enhance the security of personal computing devices, network infrastructures, embedded applications, and virtualization systems.
- Investigating vulnerabilities that arise at the intersection of hardware and software security mechanisms by reverse-engineering diverse CPU microarchitectures and systematically analyzing security-critical software components, such as OS kernels, language runtimes, and browsers.
