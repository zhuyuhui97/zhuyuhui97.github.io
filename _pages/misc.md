- **Embedded Systems:** 
  Firmware development, microcontrollers, Bluetooth, LoRa, PCB design.
- **Systems & Tools:**

I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the hard-core techniques that underpin computer systems! In addition to the skills above, I enjoy exploring and quickly adapting to new tools and technologies when needed (and sometimes forgetting them later ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). All these experiences have helped me understand how computer systems work ‚Äî not just how to use them. ü§ó
